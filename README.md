# 42 Libft

Libft is the first project of 42 cursus. It required basic knowledge in C and Shell.

## Part 1 - Lifbt functions

In this first part, were re-coded a set of the libc functions, as defined in their man. The functions needed to present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals. The functions’ names were prefixed by “ft_”. For instance strlen becomes ft_strlen.

isalpha • isdigit • isalnum • isascii • isprint • strlen • memset • bzero • memcpy • memmove • strlcpy • strlcat • toupper • tolower • strchr • strrchr • strncmp • memchr • memcmp • strnstr • atoi • calloc • strdup

## Part 2 - Additional functions

In this second part, were coded a set of functions that are either not included in the libc, or included in a different form.

ft_substr • ft_strjoin • ft_strtrim • ft_split • ft_itoa • ft_strmapi • ft_striteri • ft_putchar_fd • ft_putstr_fd • ft_putendl_fd • ft_putnbr_fd

## Part 3 - Bonus part

In this last part were coded a set of functions to manipulate lists.

ft_lstnew • ft_lstadd_front • ft_lstsize • ft_lstlast • ft_lstadd_back • ft_lstdelone • ft_lstclear • ft_lstiter • ft_lstmap
